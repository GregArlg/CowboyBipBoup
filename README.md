Welcome to CowboyBipBoup, a software made for sound hunters struggling to sort their recorded files according to UCS nomenclature.

To use it in the best way possible, create a Google Sheet based on the Excel Template from the project.
When you go for a hunt, create a new folder tab to detail the context like the gear you are using, the date or the place.
When you record a sound, take out your phone and fill your folder sheet by adding a new row detailing the sound specs.

At your next file sorting, just download the Google Sheet as a xlsx, launch CowboyBipBoup, and paste the full file path of your xlsx.
IMPORTANT: Do not enable modifications on your downloaded xlsx! The software needs raw text in the cells, if some are formulas the serialization will bug and you will have wrong data.
